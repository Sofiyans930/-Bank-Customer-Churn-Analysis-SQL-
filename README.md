# Bank Customer Churn Analysis (SQL)

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for the banking industry using SQL (MySQL).  
The goal is to understand patterns in customer behavior and identify segments with the highest risk of churn.

**This project was completed as part of a MentorMind Menternship (co-certified by UpGrad).**

---

## 💼 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major issue for banks because losing customers impacts revenue and future growth.  
This analysis helps answer:
- How many customers churned vs stayed?
- Which segments are most likely to churn (by geography, gender, activity, number of products)?
- What business steps can reduce churn?

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL)** for querying and analysis  
- **DDL & DML commands** to structure and manipulate data  
- **Window functions** for ranking and segmentation

---

## 📊 Dataset Summary
- Dataset: Bank_Churn_Dataset.csv  
- Total customers: **10,000**  
- Churned customers (Exited = 1): **2,037**  
- Retained customers (Exited = 0): **7,963**

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Germany** has the highest churn rate (**32.44%**)  
- **Inactive members** churn much more than active members  
- Customers with **3–4 products** have very high churn rates (up to 100%)
